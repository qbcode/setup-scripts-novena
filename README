This is based on the stock Angstrom build. To make the novena disk image, run

bitbake novena-bringup-image

Below are the amended notes originally bundled with the bitbake system, based on the beagleboard:

These are the setup scripts for the Angstorm buildsystem. If you want to (re)build packages or images for Angstrom, this is the thing to use.

To configure the scripts and download the build metadata, do:

	$ MACHINE=novena ./oebb.sh config novena

To start a build of the kernel, do:

	$ MACHINE=novena ./oebb.sh bitbake virtual/kernel

For an example workflow for dealing with kernels please read http://www.slimlogic.co.uk/2011/05/openembeddedangstrom-kernel-workflow/

To update the metadata, do:

	$ git pull
	$ ./oebb.sh update
